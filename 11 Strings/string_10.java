// Why string are immutable in java?
// when we give same value to the two different strings without using new key work that time they are not going to create new string innside the heap , instead, they are going to point out with the same given string.
// when we use new key word that time it is going to create new string and point out it.
// that is why string are inmmutable in java they are not going to change the string , instead, they are going to create new string and point out to the new string
